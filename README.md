Waloli Public Blogging CMS (Wapublic)

Wapublic is dedicated for you who wanted to use public blogging CMS (Content Management System) like Wordpress.com or Blogger.com to manage your blog contents and use them in your own site without worrying about your disk space. :)

Wapublic is dedicated for CodeIgniter use, but of course you can expand it into another PHP framework if you want to. Currently, Wapublic focuses on Wordpress.com REST API (http://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api).
