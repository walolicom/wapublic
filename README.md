Waloli.com Public Blogging ( Library for CodeIgniter / CMS ), We call it <b>wapublic</b>, is dedicated for you who wanted to use common blogging CMS (content management system) like Wordpress.com or Blogger.com (aka. blogspot.com) to manage your blog contents and use them in your own site without worrying about your server space. :)

Wapublic is dedicated for CodeIgniter (CI), but of course you can expand it into another PHP framework if you wanted to. Currently, Wapublic focuses on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api">Wordpress.com REST API</a>, Blogger.com will be our next focus. Wapublic has 2 (two) branches for now:
<ol>
<li><b>devel-library</b> (default), consists of wapublic config file, wapublic library, and controller as an example.</li>
<li><b>devel-cms</b>, consists of devel-library branch and whole CI application package to use as one public blogging CMS</li>
</ol>
