Waloli Public Blogging CMS (Wapublic) is dedicated for you who wanted to use public blogging CMS (Content Management System) like Wordpress.com or Blogger.com to manage your blog contents and use them in your own site without worrying about your disk space. :)

Wapublic is dedicated for CodeIgniter, but of course you can expand it into another PHP framework if you wanted to. Currently, Wapublic focuses on Wordpress.com REST API (http://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api).

If you like this project, you can buy me a coffe. :) <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=paypal%40latuminggi%2ecom&lc=US&item_name=Waloli%2ecom&item_number=wapublic&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_SM%2egif%3aNonHosted"><img src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_SM.gif" alt="Donate" /></a>
